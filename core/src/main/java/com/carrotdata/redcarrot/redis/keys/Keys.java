  /**
   * EXPIRE key seconds [NX|XX|GT|LT]
   * <p>
   * Available since 1.0.0. Time complexity: O(1) Set a timeout on key. After the timeout has
   * expired, the key will automatically be deleted. A key with an associated timeout is often said
   * to be volatile in Redis terminology. The timeout will only be cleared by commands that delete
   * or overwrite the contents of the key, including DEL, SET, GETSET and all the *STORE commands.
   * This means that all the operations that conceptually alter the value stored at the key without
   * replacing it with a new one will leave the timeout untouched. For instance, incrementing the
   * value of a key with INCR, pushing a new value into a list with LPUSH, or altering the field
   * value of a hash with HSET are all operations that will leave the timeout untouched. The timeout
   * can also be cleared, turning the key back into a persistent key, using the PERSIST command. If
   * a key is renamed with RENAME, the associated time to live is transferred to the new key name.
   * If a key is overwritten by RENAME, like in the case of an existing key Key_A that is
   * overwritten by a call like RENAME Key_B Key_A, it does not matter if the original Key_A had a
   * timeout associated or not, the new key Key_A will inherit all the characteristics of Key_B.
   * Note that calling EXPIRE/PEXPIRE with a non-positive timeout or EXPIREAT/PEXPIREAT with a time
   * in the past will result in the key being deleted rather than expired (accordingly, the emitted
   * key event will be del, not expired).
   * <p>
   * Options The EXPIRE command supports a set of options since Redis 7.0: NX -- Set expiry only
   * when the key has no expiry XX -- Set expiry only when the key has an existing expiry GT -- Set
   * expiry only when the new expiry is greater than current one LT -- Set expiry only when the new
   * expiry is less than current one A non-volatile key is treated as an infinite TTL for the
   * purpose of GT and LT. The GT, LT and NX options are mutually exclusive.
   * @param map sorted map set
   * @param keyPtr key address
   * @param keySize key size
   * @param seconds seconds to live
   * @return 1 - success, 0 - was not set, -1 - key does not exist
