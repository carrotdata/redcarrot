  /**
   * SHUTDOWN [NOSAVE|SAVE]
   *
   * <p>Available since 1.0.0. The command behavior is the following:
   *
   * <p>Stop all the clients. Perform a blocking SAVE if at least one save point is configured.
   * Flush the Append Only File if AOF is enabled. Quit the server. If persistence is enabled this
   * commands makes sure that Redis is switched off without the lost of any data. This is not
   * guaranteed if the client uses simply SAVE and then QUIT because other clients may alter the DB
   * data between the two commands. Note: A Redis instance that is configured for not persisting on
   * disk (no AOF configured, nor "save" directive) will not dump the RDB file on SHUTDOWN, as
   * usually you don't want Redis instances used only for caching to block on when shutting down.
   *
   * <p>SAVE and NOSAVE modifiers
   *
   * <p>It is possible to specify an optional modifier to alter the behavior of the command.
   * Specifically: SHUTDOWN SAVE will force a DB saving operation even if no save points are
   * configured. SHUTDOWN NOSAVE will prevent a DB saving operation even if one or more save points
   * are configured. (You can think of this variant as an hypothetical ABORT command that just stops
   * the server). Conditions where a SHUTDOWN fails When the Append Only File is enabled the
   * shutdown may fail because the system is in a state that does not allow to safely immediately
   * persist on disk. Normally if there is an AOF child process performing an AOF rewrite, Redis
   * will simply kill it and exit. However there are two conditions where it is unsafe to do so, and
   * the SHUTDOWN command will be refused with an error instead. This happens when: The user just
   * turned on AOF, and the server triggered the first AOF rewrite in order to create the initial
   * AOF file. In this context, stopping will result in losing the dataset at all: once restarted,
   * the server will potentially have AOF enabled without having any AOF file at all. A replica with
   * AOF enabled, reconnected with its master, performed a full resynchronization, and restarted the
   * AOF file, triggering the initial AOF creation process. In this case not completing the AOF
   * rewrite is dangerous because the latest dataset received from the master would be lost. The new
   * master can actually be even a different instance (if the REPLICAOF or SLAVEOF command was used
   * in order to reconfigure the replica), so it is important to finish the AOF rewrite and start
   * with the correct data set representing the data set in memory when the server was terminated.
   * There are conditions when we want just to terminate a Redis instance ASAP, regardless of what
   * its content is. In such a case, the right combination of commands is to send a CONFIG
   * appendonly no followed by a SHUTDOWN NOSAVE. T he first command will turn off the AOF if
   * needed, and will terminate the AOF rewriting child if there is one active. The second command
   * will not have any problem to execute since the AOF is no longer enabled.
   *
   * <p>Return value:
   *
   * <p>Simple string reply on error. On success nothing is returned since the server quits and the
   * connection is closed.
